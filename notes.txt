My webapp (showmystock.com) bridges the gap between sources, retailers and clients, allowing them to monitor real time inventory levels of each other, we also have a 
marketplace that allows them to advertise products and services, we will also have a "live quote" function that users can use to send to clients so they know
they have stock of an item they can deliver.

My progress on the webapp is: 
Header = divided Left middle and right section. 
- Left will be the search bar, where users can search the site

- Middle has 4 icons, Home, Suppliers, Clients, marketplace
-- Home: Users can put their feed here, company news, promotions etc.
-- Suppliers: Users can follow the feed of their suppliers here
-- Clients: Users can follow the feed of their clients here
-- marketplace: Users can post and view adds here

- Right side: User navigation:

- Menu: Where user can see all the options of the site, 

-- Menu: Discover and Connect: Find Suppliers, Find Clients, Marketplace Search, Quotes

Question:
-- I have finished my header and menu items, now I want to start with my protected routes, so if a user is logged in then they can access the protected routes, but if there is no user, then what should I do? Only be able to see the login page? Or must I make them able to see other useres feed? so to promote engagement?
