My webapp (showmystock.com) bridges the gap between sources, retailers and clients, allowing them to monitor real time inventory levels of each other, we also have a 
marketplace that allows them to advertise products and services, we will also have a "live quote" function that users can use to send to clients so they know
they have stock of an item they can deliver.
